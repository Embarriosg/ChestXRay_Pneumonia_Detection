    "Es una pregunta que se reliza en el paper Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition donde se documento en 2015 la primera ResNet por parte del equipo de Microsoft, y eso es lo que hace una Red residual, al comienzo de el aprendizaje computacional las redes comvolucionales tenian un peor desempeño mediante se le agregaban mas capas, entonces la resNeet trata este problema saltando entre capas y dando como resultado?\n",

    "- What is ResNet 18?\n",
    "As part of the ResNet family, ResNet-18 is the smallest and most lightweight model, making it a popular choice for fast experimentation, deployment, and educational use. Additionally, ResNet-18 is the goto model for image classification and is a reliable starting point balancing speed, accuracy, and simplicity. For longer training times and potentially better accuracy, within the family is ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, etc.<br>\n",
